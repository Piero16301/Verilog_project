# Verilog project
Computer Architecture final project

Directory: Program_test1
We enter in this directory and here we compile these both files and we test arithmetic operations
#> iverilog Datapath.v Test_datapath.v
#> ./a.out

Directory: Program_test2
We enter in this directory and Here we compile these both files and we test load and store operations
#> iverilog Datapath.v Test_datapath.v
#> ./a.out

Directory: Program_test3
We enter in this directory and Here we compile these both files and we test branch and jump operations with a for loop program
#> iverilog Datapath.v Test_datapath.v
#> ./a.out

Directory: Test_Factorial
We enter in this directory and Here we compile these both files and we test the overall datapath executing a factorial program (factorial of 10 = 3628800)
#> iverilog Datapath.v Test_datapath.v
#> ./a.out
